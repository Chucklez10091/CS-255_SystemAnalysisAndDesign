# CS-255_SystemAnalysisAndDesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass Project was a system to be designed for a driver's education program aimed at improving drivers' ability to pass the written and on-street driver's license exams. 

What did you do particularly well?
Frankly, I thought this was an area of development where I could most accurately be described as adequate to the task. I didn't feel particularly challenged, nor exceptionally proficient

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Completeness of requirements. I understand the basics, but I anticipate that I missed some that I don't know to think of yet. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
This is an area where I will most benefit from simply gaining hands-on experience, or at least guided development. I took most of the "customer"'s requests at face value, and few additional requirements I identified demonstrated any
real creativity, though I'm not certain to what degree that is due to the nature of the project.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I much prefer piece-meal implementation, though I won't pretend to deny the value of a top-down holistic approach to the design process.
